Description: An approach to automatically generate stormwater
    drainage networks using open source spatial data.  The aim is to keep
    existing urban structures and rebuild the pipe system as close to
    reality as possible.  The artificial stormwater drainage network is
    derived from existing urban structures, such as land use, topography
    and streets. Required input data are publicly available.  The result
    is a SWMM input file including a complete drainage network model with
    discharging surfaces, junctions, conduits and outfalls.

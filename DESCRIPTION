Description: An approach to automatically generate stormwater drainage networks using open source spatial data. 
    The aim is to keep existing urban structures and rebuild the pipe system as close to reality as possible. 
    The artificial stormwater drainage network is derived from existing urban structures, 
    such as land use, topography and streets. Required input data are publicly available. 
    The result is a SWMM input file including a complete drainage network model with discharging surfaces, junctions, conduits and outfalls.
